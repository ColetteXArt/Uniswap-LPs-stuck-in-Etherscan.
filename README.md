# Uniswap-LPs-stuck-in-Etherscan.
I need help to get these three pairs that I can see in Uniswap and on Etherscan. But I don't know how to move to wallet, I see read and write code, but the buttons in uniswap.org are missing like they were previously, so I even see them in UNI pool but can not withdraw? Help?
